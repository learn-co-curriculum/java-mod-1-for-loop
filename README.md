# The for Statement

## Learning Goals

- Use for statements

## The for Statement in Java

The `for` loop is another way to indicate that we want to go through a section
of code multiple times. Instead of a single condition like the `while` loop, the
`for` loop takes multiple parameters:

1. An initializing statement that is run once before the content of the `for`
   loop is run
2. A conditional statement that is evaluated once _before_ each run through the
   `for` loop and must be true in order for the content of the `for` loop to be
   executed
3. An "update" statement that is run once _after_ each run through the `for`
   loop

The syntax is as follows:

```java
for (<initializing-statement>; <condition-statement>; <update-statement>) {
    <code-to-run-for-each-iteration-through-the-loop>
}
```

This kind of loop is very well suited to cases where we know in advance how many
times we want to go through a specific set of instructions. For example, let's
consider that I want to print a message to the console 5 times - I would write
the following code:

```java
for (int counter = 0; counter < 5; counter++) {
    System.out.println("Message for you");
}
```

Let's break down what this `for` loop does:

1. Define a variable named `counter` and initialize it to `0`
2. Establish that the code inside the `for` loop code block should run as long
   as counter is less than 5
3. Establish that the value of counter should be incremented by one every time
   the loop is executed

This will produce the following output:

```
Message for you
Message for you
Message for you
Message for you
Message for you
```

The message is displayed 5 times - let's go through the first iteration:

1. The first time, `counter` is `0`, so the condition `counter < 5` is true, so
   the loop executes
2. The message is displayed
3. After the loop executes, `counter` is incremented by `1` and therefore is now
   `1`

Now let's go through the next iteration:

1. The initializing statement is not executed anymore because we are no longer
   on the first iteration
2. The condition is evaluated to see if we should go through the loop a second
   time. `counter` is equal to `1`, which is less than `5`, so we execute the
   loop
3. The message is displayed
4. After the loop executes, `counter` is incremented by `1` and therefore is
   now `2`

This goes on until `counter` is incremented to `5`, at which point the condition
`counter < 5` is no longer `true`, and therefore the code inside the `for` loop
should not execute and `for` loop is done.

We can change this code slightly to make it more obvious that changes are
happening as we're going through each iteration of the `for` loop:

```java
        for (int counter = 0; counter < 5; counter++) {
            System.out.println("Message " + counter + " for you");
        }
```

This produces the following output:

```
Message 0 for you
Message 1 for you
Message 2 for you
Message 3 for you
Message 4 for you
```

You will notice that the output starts counting at `0`. That's because we
initialized our `counter` variable at `0`. However, the `counter` variable can
be initialized at any value and the condition statement can be updated
accordingly to make sure we only go through the `for` loop `5` times:

```java
        for (int counter = 17; counter < 22; counter++) {
            System.out.println("Message " + counter + " for you");
        }
```

This will produce the following output:

```
Message 17 for you
Message 18 for you
Message 19 for you
Message 20 for you
Message 21 for you
```
